# CPS-Approximate-Pruning
This is the code for implementation in paper:
Zhigao Guo, Anthony C Constantinou, Approximate learning of high dimensional Bayesian network structures via pruning of Candidate Parent Sets, 22(10), 2020. https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/22/10/1142/htm

The CPS (Candidate Parent Sets) files are generated using GOBNILP at https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/aig/sw/gobnilp/. The tested data are from http://constantinou.info/downloads/bayesys/bayesys_repository.pdf.
